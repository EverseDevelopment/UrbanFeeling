## Getting Started
You can go to the current Urban feeling website

## How it works
1- We obtain multiple parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Season, Population, Security, etc of the selected city<br/>
2- Information is transform into feelings<br/>
3- We use those feelings to feed an AI model for Audio and Video<br/>
4- We generate an esoteric composition that will take your state of mind to the selected city<br/>
